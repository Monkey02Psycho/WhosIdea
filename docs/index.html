    <h1>Who's Idea? Mod</h1>
    <p>An explanation of my code and forge</p>
    <h4>What is forge?</h4>
    <p>Forge is an open source tool to program mods for Minecraft. Forge removes obfuscation from Minecrafts code and
        provides tools so developers can add more content to the game. Forge also acts as a loader to load code from the
        mods into the game. Forge is not officially supported by Mojang(The owners of Minecraft) so all of forge and
        modding in general is community ran</p>

    <h3>Basic Structure of a Mod</h3>
    <img src="mod_structure.PNG" alt="">
    <p>This is roughly the basic structure of a mod. The src folder contains all the packages for the mod. The main
        package is the main folder of the mod. inside that are two sub folders. java and resources. Inside java is where
        all the code is located. in resources is where all of the various resources are held. I will go more in depth in
        these in a later section</p>
